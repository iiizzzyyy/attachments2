Thanks for visiting our site Robert.  I don't have you in our database, what machine model are you referring to?

MackQ (Fri, 9/4/2020, 09:57:34 am)
Please email us to support@jorlink.com your contact details along with machine model, serial number and age.  If the unit is less than a year old, it should be under warranty.  But, normally alarms could be caused by a block, filter saturation or other causes.

Send us a video clip and images of the problem please to support@jorlink.com and we will be glad to assist.

We have an es30 and are getting a exhaust filter fault....we have changed the filter but not the metal or  carbon...any ideas??

MackQ (Fri, 9/4/2020, 10:00:27 am)
Uhmmm, I don't recognize the model ES30, that is NOT a Purex filtration system.  When was the last time you changed the main filter (metal)?  Do you have an idea of the cycle time between filters?

Robert Scott (Fri, 9/4/2020, 10:01:18 am)
I work at General Motors in Toledo ...probably never changed the metal filter...we have had this unit less than a year...
